[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/GTR-GAMES/Deep-Hierarchical-Planning/releases)

## üìñ About This Project

Welcome to the **Deep-Hierarchical-Planning** project. This software is a PyTorch reimplementation of the "Deep Hierarchical Planning" reinforcement learning framework. It includes a multi-model architecture with unique features. 

Key components:
- **Manager-Worker Policies**: This allows efficient task management.
- **World Model**: Helps in simulating environments to improve learning.
- **Goal Autoencoder**: Automatically identifies goals to streamline planning.

The package is built using Python and PyTorch and features experiment logging with Weights & Biases for tracking.

## üöÄ Getting Started

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions within the application for initial setup and usage.

### üìä Using the Features

- **Manager-Worker Policies**: This feature allows you to set up multiple worker agents managed by a central manager agent. This setup helps distribute tasks efficiently.
  
- **World Model**: Utilize the world model to simulate environments. This can significantly speed up your learning process.

- **Goal Autoencoder**: Automatically set goals based on previous learning activities. This feature enhances the efficiency of your planning.

## üìà Logging Experiments

**Deep-Hierarchical-Planning** integrates with Weights & Biases for logging experiments. 

1. **Set Up Your Account**: If you don‚Äôt have a Weights & Biases account, create one at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).

2. **Log In Through the Application**: Add your API key to the application settings to start tracking experiments.

3. **View Experiment Results**: Monitor your training results directly on the Weights & Biases platform.
